# NeuralNetworkCalculator 1.1.0

Neural network calculator is a library to make calculation for deep learning easier.

This library is made most for my personal use, but I hope it can be useful for others too.

# Example code

The example code that I made is at below:

# update 1.1.0
- Improved the looking of the code & added a class for input layer
- Added __convolution and __Pooling class (still in development. Not available for use)
- Removed the normal library that calculates using Numpy. (May will be added back in the future again)
